/** Notes
 - "reserved": Each bit in these bytes can be used to change the behavior of the protocol. An email from Bram suggests that trailing bits should be used first, so that leading bits may be used to change the meaning of trailing bits.
 - "peer_id": This is usually the same peer_id that is transmitted in tracker requests (but not always e.g. an anonymity option in Azureus).
